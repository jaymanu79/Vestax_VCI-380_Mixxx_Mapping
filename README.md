This is my mapping using the VESTAX VCI-380 controller with Mixxx software.
It's the first time i'm doing a mapping, and I did it with my own use in mind, so I would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions for changes or improvement.

Here's how to use this mapping :

# Mixer functions

Main knobs and sliders work straightforward.
Use SHIFT+crossfader to controle output balance

# Wheels

* Touch and turn wheels to activate scratching.
* With shift, fast scratching at 10X speed
* Turn wheels without touching the sensitive part to make temporary rate adjustments (jog)
note : wheels should turn red when touched. if not, adjust the touch sensitivity on the front panel.
* The LED ring shows the play position of the track. It does one revolution for the full length of the track. 

# SYNC / CUE / >||

|Key|Function|
|---|---|
|<kbd>PLAY</kbd>|Play/pause|
|<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>PLAY</kbd>|reverse play|
|<kbd>CUE</kbd>|go to cue point|
|<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>CUE</kbd>|set the cue point|
|<kbd>SYNC</kbd>|blinks on each beat. Press to adjust beatgrid position.|
|<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>SYNC</kbd>|activates auto-sync|


# Tempo sliders

Adjust pitch
<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + move : reset speed to 1X
<kbd>RANGE</kbd> : toggle keylock

# Navigation area

Turn the center wheel to scroll
Toggle <kbd>BACK</kbd> to select scroll zone : ON = left panel, OFF = tracklist
<kbd>FWD</kbd> : fold/unfold subdirectories
JOGSCROLL+<kbd>LOAD A</kbd> / <kbd>LOAD B</kbd> : Load the track into deck A or B

Push the center wheel to load and play a track into preview deck
<kbd>VIEW</kbd> : play/pause preview deck

<kbd>AREA</kbd> : Toggle Auto-DJ ( think A(rea) as A(utodj) )

# Effects

<kbd>FX SELECT</kbd> : Select an effect. Inactive with Mixxx versions up to 1.11, where only one effect is available : Flanger. Other functions below do work, and apply to Flanger.
<kbd>FX ON/OFF</kbd> : Toggle effect on each deck.
<kbd>FX DEPTH</kbd> : adjust wet/dry parameter
Adjust other parameters : see "performance pads", effects control

# Performance pads and strip

They work in different modes, according to the selection buttons on the top of the controller.
My modes are not always related to the names they bear on the controller :

## <kbd>HOT CUE</kbd> : HOTCUES
8 hot cues available, one per pad
the pads light up in green when their hotcue is set
push a lighted pad to play the hotcue
push a blank pad to set a new hotcue to the current position.
shift+green pad to clear a hotcue

left strip : needle drop (quick navigate) on the preview deck
<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + strip : needle drop on main decks

<kbd>SLICER</kbd> : EFFECTS CONTROL
	parameters for the current effect (see Effects paragraph) are assigned to pads.
	each available parameter appears as a blue pad, and pad 8 is the "SuperKnob" in light blue.
	push a pad to select a parameter - SuperKnob is the default - and touch the strip to change its value 


<kbd>AUTO LOOP</kbd> : not used - suggestions welcome
<kbd>ROLL</kbd> : not used - suggestions welcome
<kbd>SAMPLER</kbd> (<kbd>SHIFT> + <kbd>HOT CUE</kbd>) : not used yet - planning to control samplers from here
